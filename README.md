## Requirements
A few of these projects use data analysis and data visualization to make inferences from the data. Libraries that are used include:
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- lxml
- re
- plotly
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Expectations
These projects are designed to challenge your web scraping skills and also presenting the data.  


## Caution
Although I will try to keep these projects updated, please keep in mind that websites can change at any time, making an existing scraper useless.
